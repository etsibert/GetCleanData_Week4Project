# Coursera Get & Clean Data Week 4 Project
## Objective:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

##Submission: 
  * a tidy data set produced with the run_analysis.R script, 
  * a link to a Github repository containing the run_analysis.R script and supporting documentation, 
  * a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data (CodeBook.md). You should also include a README.md
  * this Readme.md file
  
##Background information:
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced wearable computing algorithms to attract new users. 
The data used in this project represents data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones during a study.

The [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/etsibert/GetCleanData_Week4Project/blob/master/CodeBook.md) file contains information about the Tidy data set features as well as the data transfomrations (R code) performed by the [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/etsibert/GetCleanData_Week4Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) script file.
